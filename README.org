#+TITLE: com.reilysiegel/new.lib

This is a modified version of seancorfield's `lib` template, with the following
changes:

- ~README~ is in org-mode format
- MPL 2.0 is used as the default license instead of EPL 1.0
- ~CHANGELOG~ is excluded
- ~doc/intro.md~ is excluded

* Usage

This is a template project for use with
[deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new). As originally generated,
it will produce a new library project when run:

#+begin_src bash
clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {io.github.reilysiegel/new.lib {:git/sha "SHA"}}}' -Tnew
create :template com.reilysiegel/new.lib :name myusername/mycoollib
#+end_src

Assuming you have installed `deps-new` as your `new` "tool" via:

#+begin_src bash
clojure -Ttools install io.github.seancorfield/deps-new '{:git/tag "v0.4.2"}'
:as new
#+end_src

Run this template project's tests (by default, this just validates your
template's `template.edn` file -- that it is valid EDN and it satisfies the
`deps-new` Spec for template files):

#+begin_src bash
clojure -T:build test
#+end_src
