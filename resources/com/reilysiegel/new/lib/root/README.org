* Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

Run the project's tests:

#+begin_src bash
$ clojure -T:build test
#+end_src

Run the project's CI pipeline and build a JAR:

#+begin_src bash
$ clojure -T:build ci
#+end_src

This will produce an updated ~pom.xml~ file with synchronized dependencies
inside the ~META-INF~ directory inside ~target/classes~ and the JAR in ~target~.
You can update the version (and SCM tag) information in generated ~pom.xml~ by
updating ~build.clj~.

Install it locally (requires the ~ci~ task be run first):

#+begin_src bash
$ clojure -T:build install
#+end_src

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs ~CLOJARS_USERNAME~ and ~CLOJARS_PASSWORD~
environment variables (requires the ~ci~ task be run first):

#+begin_src bash
$ clojure -T:build deploy
#+end_src

Your library will be deployed to {{group/id}}/{{artifact/id}} on clojars.org by
default.
